Ardu-gyver Obstacle Course -- Ardu-ninja?

Configure the Arduino to get past actual obstacles:

Challenge:

* Remove the arduino to start the countdown (Raspberry pi Controlled)
* Controlling a Servo to release more parts
* Wiring a simple robot to send through a hole and back for the IR leds 
* Bonus: Turning off the television (raspberry pi controlled) before the timer hit's zero
