hello world
* blinking led
  * different types of leds
  * mysterious non-blinking leds (segue to next section)
* tv-b-gone -- must give spiel (followed by learn to solder hackathon -- remember to bring a lot of leadsolder for the fumes)

How to use I2C:
* Adafruit RGB Strips
* Gyroscope and sensor control
* I2C Sensor and Readouts
* I2C spider

Sensors:
* Simple Arduino sensor Using hte EEPROM Library (can be used up to 100,000 times per avr microcontroller -- which are 4$ each, thus this is great for slow sensor reads)
* using the computer for a sensor
  * Python
  * Bash (if mac or linux)
* SD Card Shield
* Bluetooth Shields
 * how to use the comport to access the bluetooth shield (linux and mac) 


Dual-Boot-a-thon! Want another operating system on your computer besides windows? Try out debian-based linux (which is compatible with most of our courses)!



Learn to Solder Hackathon:

  * Mitch Altman's soldering guide for sale
  * Dioabolino: build your own Arduino
  * The Iconic Minty-Boost
  * The Famous TV-B-Gone Kit
  * The small Buck-Boost Night Light Kit
  * The POV Signal
  * The RGB Wave
  * LOL Shield
  * SMD Soldering kits for the skilled
  * Shift Register Table
  * RTC kit http://www.adafruit.com/products/264 -- datalogging and for everyday stopwatches and timers.

how to create 
* How to use a library (Adafruit)
* How to make a library
  * cpp file
  * .h file with class prototype and stuff you want to let your user muck with
  * keywords.txt for highlighting
    * highlighting levels (Keyword1, keyword2, etc).
  * example files
    * remember to hold the example file in it's own folder of the same name (minus the .ino portion)
  * cannot add a library within a library, that's the current rule
  * licensing cool stuff -- MIT licenses, GNU, and public domain

* Libraries so useful, they come with Arduino IDE: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries



Hackathon #2:

Ardu-gyver Obstacle Course -- Ardu-ninja?

Configure the Arduino to get past actual obstacles:




Challenge:

* Remove the arduino to start the countdown (Raspberry pi Controlled)
* Controlling a Servo to release more parts
* Wiring a simple robot to send through a hole and back for the IR leds 
* Bonus: Turning off the television (raspberry pi controlled) before the timer hit's zero
