hello world
* blinking led
  * different types of leds
  * mysterious non-blinking leds (segue to next section)
* tv-b-gone -- must give spiel (followed by learn to solder hackathon -- remember to bring a lot of leadsolder for the fumes)

How to use I2C:
* Adafruit RGB Strips
* Gyroscope and sensor control
* I2C Sensor and Readouts
* I2C spider

Sensors:
* Simple Arduino sensor Using hte EEPROM Library (can be used up to 100,000 times per avr microcontroller -- which are 4$ each, thus this is great for slow sensor reads)
* using the computer for a sensor
  * Python
  * Bash (if mac or linux)
* SD Card Shield
* Bluetooth Shields
 * how to use the comport to access the bluetooth shield (linux and mac) 


Dual-Boot-a-thon! Want another operating system on your computer besides windows? Try out debian-based linux (which is compatible with most of our courses)!

Hackathon #2:

Ardu-gyver Obstacle Course -- Ardu-ninja?

Configure the Arduino to get past actual obstacles:

Challenge:

* Remove the arduino to start the countdown (Raspberry pi Controlled)
* Controlling a Servo to release more parts
* Wiring a simple robot to send through a hole and back for the IR leds 
* Bonus: Turning off the television (raspberry pi controlled) before the timer hit's zero
